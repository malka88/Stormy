Android application showing the weather at the current hour.
There is a function to update the data by clicking on the Refresh button.
The weather data is taken from the open-source weather API https://open-meteo.com/

The next update will add a 7-day data output (there is currently processing of this data, but no output), as well as caching of data received from the API for a smaller number of requests.
